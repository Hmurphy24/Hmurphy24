Hello there! I am an Information Systems student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, concentrating in cybersecurity. Currently interning as a Cyber Security Research Assistant at UAH, I am passionate about protecting organizations against external threats and ensuring the integrity of their valuable data. 

I am currently practicing my skills as a Cyber Security Research Assistant at UAH, where I am actively contributing to cybersecurity research projects and gaining hands-on experience with various security topics. This internship has given me a basic proficiency with multiple scripting languages such as PowerShell, Batch, and Bash and has strengthened my programming foundation immensely. It has also increased my understanding of the Windows 10 operating system leading to a more secure digital experience.

Moreover, as a business major, I am captivated by the critical role cybersecurity plays in preserving an organization's digital integrity. My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation, and I have embraced the challenge of programming to solve complex problems. From conceptualizing and coding games to participating in Capture the Flag exercises, I continually seek opportunities to expand my skill set.
